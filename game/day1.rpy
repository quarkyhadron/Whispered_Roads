    """
    My bedroom is pretty messy.
    """

    """ 
    Right now, the early sun's soft yellow light just barely stripes the room, 
    showing all the stuff from my life spread out on the old wooden floor. 
    """

    """ 
    My duffel bag, zipper practically screaming, is open on my bed's patchwork quilt, 
    looking like it's trying to eat all my old stuff."""

    """
    There are cardboard boxes everywhere, bent and torn.
    """

    """
    Charging wires are snaking all over my bedside table, like restless vines, 
    {w}and there’s a sad pile of lonely socks, 
    each one a forgotten soldier from a past laundry day.
    """

    """
    The floorboards let out a long, low groan when I move, 
    a sound that fills the quiet morning. 
    """
       
    """
    It’s almost like the whole house is sighing, 
    tired from years of holding up my weight, my dreams, and all that teenage angst.
    """
    
    "Dust motes, disturbed by me getting up early, 
    dance in the sunlight coming through the slightly dirty window. 
    "

    "Each tiny speck just hangs there for a second, lit up, 
    like little galaxies frozen in time.
    "

    "I kneel by the bed, the soft quilt fabric bunching under my knees. {w} 
    My elbow bumps an old, faded receipt, and it floats off the nightstand, 
    fluttering to the floor like a forgotten memory. "

    "My duffel is packed {i}full{/i}, 
    clothes crammed in tight around the important stuff:{w}
    my tough thermos that’s been with me on so many early mornings,{w}
    my old laptop that’s seen too much homework and too many YouTube videos,
    "

    "and a notebook with a peeling cover, its blank pages ready for new thoughts.
    "

    char_reid "This floor’s always been loud, hasn’t it?"

    "I let out a small, kind of sad chuckle."

    char_reid "…Should have cleaned in here before packing. Probably ever."

    "I put a hand down to steady myself as I shift. The floor groans again, 
    deeper this time, like the house is totally agreeing with me about how messy I am."

    char_reid "Guess I’m leaving it a mess. My last act of teenage rebellion against having to be organized."

    "The room smells familiar and comforting:{w} 
    a faint, clean smell of laundry{w}, mixed with old books stacked too high on a shelf,
    "

    "and a bit of dry dirt from the dying plant on my windowsill—a 
    quiet reminder of how bad I am at keeping things alive."

    "The walls are like a storybook of my life: 
    faded movie tickets stuck all over my corkboard, 
    each one a memory of a laugh or a first date;"
    
    "a messy pile of socks on my dresser, their random colors showing how little 
    I care about sorting laundry;"

    "a cracked ceramic mug, its chipped rim a familiar imperfection, 
    overflowing with random pens, 
    each one holding stories of forgotten notes and doodles.
    "

    "From the hall, the low hum of our ancient refrigerator fills the silence.
    {w}It’s been the background noise of my whole childhood."

    "Dad coughs once, a dry sound that means he’s up early.{w}
    Then, Mom’s footsteps start, a steady back and forth, showing how worried she is.
    "

    "Deeper in the house, I can hear my brother’s muffled shouts from his room, the usual sounds of 
    video game battles rumbling through the floorboards."

    #thinking char_reid sprite
    char_reid "{i}Ben’s probably still asleep. 
    {w} Or pretending to be, just trying to avoid saying goodbye again.{/i}"

    char_reid "{i}We already did that last night, a quick, awkward hug that felt too rushed, too... final.{/i}"

    "I reached up to the top shelf, my fingers brushing against the rough wood, and pulled down an old flannel shirt."

    "It felt comforting in my hands, its familiar weight."

    "A clear line of dust, untouched for months, maybe years, 
    showed where it had been.{w}My fingers left clean marks in the dust."

    #thinking 
    char_reid "{i}Four years, and that shelf just is still as dusty as ever.
    {w}Perfect example of how good I am at keeping things tidy.{/i}"

    "I shook my head a little, a small smile playing on my lips."

    #thinking
    char_reid "{i}Guess the dust lives here now. It's earned its spot.{/i}"

    "I touched the edge of my bed as I stood up, the old springs protesting with another groan."

    "I grabbed the framed photo from my cluttered dresser:{w} a picture from the summer fair, a moment frozen in time."

    "My ears looked huge in the bright sun, my teenage smile a little crooked.{w} Ben, being Ben, had photobombed in the background with a goofy peace sign behind my head."


    "The cardboard frame was bent and soft from years of holding it, but the real smiles in the picture were still bright as ever."

    #thinking
    char_reid "{i}I don’t want to go. Not really. This is home. This is familiar.{/i}"

    "I held the frame tighter, my thumb tracing the blurry outline of Ben’s silly grin.
    {w}Then mine, a younger, more carefree version of myself."

    char_reid "{i}But I have to. This is the next step. The grown-up thing.{/i}"

    #SFX
    "A distinct creak from the hallway.{w=0.5} Another soft, hesitant step.
    {w=0.5}A gentle cough, closer now.{w=0.5} The house made a quiet, almost silent noise, like it was holding its breath, waiting for me to leave."

    "Then I heard Mom—a quick, sharp gasp, followed by a soft, unmistakable sniffle.{w}
    Not Ben’s fake sighs or dramatic coughs."

    "Mom was coming down the hall,{w=0.5} her footsteps slow but steady,{w=0.5} each one a measured beat against the wooden floor."

    "Like she was walking towards something she didn’t want 
    to face, a goodbye she wasn't ready for."

    char_reidMom "My baby...{sc=4} uuUuuuUUUuu...!{/sc}"

    char_reidDad "“Debbie, come on. It’s just college. He’s not moving to the moon."

    "I almost smiled, a small, involuntary twitch of my lips."
    
    "Still dramatic, after all these years."

    "But beneath the familiar show, a heavy feeling of real sadness hung in the air, 
    making the moment feel big, important."

    "The door opened slowly, creaking on its hinges, 
    revealing Mom standing in the doorway." 

    "She was holding my old flannel shirt—{w}the one with the slightly frayed cuffs and that 
    faint stain near the pocket{w}—like it was something precious, full of magic."
    
    "She pushed it into my chest without a word, 
    her touch lingering for a fleeting moment, like she was tucking me in one last time, 
    a silent blessing and a piece of home to carry with me.
